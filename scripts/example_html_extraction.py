    We want to extract relations from a webpage as found in the CPSV Application Profile.
    Starting from a html page, we chunk the different sections, such that we can classify relevant sections.

    The HTML page is first filtered to remove irrelevant content.
    In the next stage, different relation extraction methods (these can be either rule-based or ML/NLP based) are applied.
    To save the relations, they are put into an RDF.
